# MPU6050 sensor overview
The MPU6050 is a module with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. The gyroscope measures rotational velocity (rad/s). This is the change of the angular position over time along the X, Y, and Z-axis (roll, pitch, and yaw). This allows us to determine the orientation of an object. The accelerometer measures acceleration (rate of change of the objectâ€™s velocity). It senses static forces like gravity (9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>) or dynamic forces like vibrations or movement. The MPU6050 measures acceleration over the X, Y, and Z-axis.(9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>) or dynamic forces like vibrations or movement.

The MPU6050 measures acceleration over the X, Y, and Z-axis. This means the MPU6050 is the ideal sensor for simulating an orbital satellite.
