## Data flow
This project required importing the `SatelliteData` struct via `SatelliteSensors::get_satellite_data()`. This means that the Qt app needs to import a class and a struct which are specific
to the Pico SDK per `CMakeLists.txt` in this directory. Because of this a default factory implementation is required so we can perform a dependency injection at run time so we can import the
factory version of `SatelliteSensors::get_satellite_data()` and then override it at run time to get the `SatelliteData` without running into any dependency/build issues. This becomes quite difficult to trace so I have made a data flow diagram detailing it. Please consult [the data flow diagram](https://example.com/data-flow-diagram) which shows the classes and methods used and the location of where they are being imported from.
